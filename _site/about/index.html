  <h1>About Dean Vun</h1>
  <p>
    I am an Operations Management and Information Systems professional with extensive experience in logistics,
    warehouse operations, and inventory control. My career has centred around designing, implementing, and sustaining
    robust WMS-based environments that support both day-to-day operations and long-term business objectives.

      <h2>How I Work</h2>
      <p>
        I focus on translating operational realities into practical system configurations and processes. This often
        means working closely with operations, IT, and external vendors to ensure that solutions are not only
        technically sound but also usable and sustainable for frontline teams.
      </p>
      <p class="about-highlight">
        My approach combines structured analysis, clear communication, and a strong emphasis on reliability,
        data integrity, and user adoption.

        given me a broad understanding of service standards, compliance, and customer expectations across different
        industries.
