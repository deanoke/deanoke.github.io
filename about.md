  <h1>About Dean Vun</h1>

  <p>
    I am an Operations Management and Information Systems professional with extensive hands-on experience in
    logistics, warehouse operations, and inventory control. Over the years, I have worked at the intersection of
    operations and technology, helping organizations deploy and sustain robust WMS-driven environments, improve
    process efficiency, and maintain high service standards.
  </p>

  <p>
    My career spans roles in third-party logistics, international shipping, and banking operations, giving me a
    well-rounded perspective across supply chain, customer service, and financial compliance domains.
  </p>

  <h2>What I Focus On</h2>

  <p>
    I enjoy designing, implementing, and stabilizing systems and processes that directly support daily operations.
    This includes:
  </p>

  <p class="about-highlight">
    Translating business requirements into practical system configurations, training users,
    and ensuring the underlying data and infrastructure remain reliable and available.
  </p>

  <h2>Professional Highlights</h2>

  <p>
    In my current role at FM Global Logistics (M) Sdn. Bhd., I lead projects around INFOR SCM WMS, inventory control,
    and EDI integration. I manage project lifecycles end-to-end, from proposal and budgeting to implementation,
    post-implementation review, and handover.
  </p>

  <p>
    Previously, at IDS Logistics Services (M) Sdn. Bhd., I worked on systems such as Exceed WMS, SAP, and Hyperion
    Brio Reporting Tools, focusing on improving the efficiency of daily logistics and warehouse operations.
  </p>

  <p>
    I also bring experience from international relocation and shipping (Seven Seas Worldwide) and financial services
    operations (HSBC Electronic Data Processing), where I developed strong customer service, team leadership, and
    audit-compliance skills.
  </p>

  <h2>How I Work</h2>

  <p>
    I value structured thinking, clear communication, and practical solutions. My approach typically combines:
  </p>

  <ul class="compact-list">
    <li>Understanding operational realities on the warehouse floor or in live service environments.</li>
    <li>Aligning system configurations and process changes with those realities.</li>
    <li>Ensuring teams are trained, supported, and confident with the tools they use.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Beyond the Role</h2>

  <p>
    I have a strong passion for continuous learning and personal growth, especially in areas where operations and
    technology intersect. I enjoy working in multicultural environments and have built strong cross-cultural
    communication skills through international and regional exposure.
